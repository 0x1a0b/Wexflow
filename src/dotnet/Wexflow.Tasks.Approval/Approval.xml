    Approval is a sequential task that marks the current workflow as needing approval.
    
    To use this task the workflow needs to be an approval workflow. 
    
    This can be done whether from the designer or by editing the XML of the workflow.
    
    If the workflow is disapproved the OnDisapproved event is triggered and the tasks after Approval
    task are not executed.
